**Hi, I'm Arpit Goyal.** Product Manager based out of Jaipur, India. After graduating with an Information technology major, I worked for startups where I honed my design style and product sensibility.

After my internship with Digital agency [Parallel Labs](https://parallellabs.io/), I developed a great interest in Design and it continued and increased with my work at [Townscript](https://www.townscript.com) and [WebEngage](https://webengage.com) as part of the core product team.

As a hobby, I write about design, tech choices and product management best practices, look forward to your reading and your views.
