**Hi, I'm Arpit Goyal.** I'm UX consultant at [Maverick.io](https://www.maverick.io), Jaipur. After graduating with Information technology as major, I worked for startups where I honed my design style and product sensibility.

After my internship with Digital agency [Parallel Labs](https://parallellabs.io/), I developed a great interest in Design and it continued and increased with my work at [Townscript](https://www.townscript.com) and [WebEngage](https://webengage.com) as part of core product team.

As a hobby, I write about design, tech choices and product manager best practices, look forward to you reading and your views.
