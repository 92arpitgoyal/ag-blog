### Problem Statement

#### Context

Akshay is a developer at a new-age startup and is usually occupied with work during the entire week. When it comes to staying fit, he can’t seem to find reliable options close to his home or office to work out. Radhika, an executive at an MNC, is in the same boat — a busy work life which involves her travelling between Mumbai-Delhi-Bangalore frequently. She couldn’t become a regular at any particular gym because of her travel-intensive job.

[Many players](https://yourstory.com/2016/04/fitness-startups/) have emerged recently to address the problems faced by people like Akshay and Radhika. These players are trying out different models to leverage the huge potential which exists in the fitness market. Some are working on onboarding gyms to provide [class pass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-how-often-you-have-to-work-out-to-make-a-ClassPass-membership-worth-it/articleshow/47966034.cms) facilities to the customers, while some are working to create an online marketplace for fitness-related options. According to a [report](https://www.smergers.com/industry-watch/india-gym-fitness-industry/), the fitness market is estimated at ₹4,500 crores and is growing at 16-18% annually.   
   
Now, suppose you’re a PM at a startup StayFit (hypothetical), which is yet to launch. With the emerging market and the growing number of potential users, the CEO has asked you to create various product artifacts of the target user segment. How would you go about this entire process of creating personas and plotting user journey maps for them?

#### Objective

The objective of this case study is to create personas and user journey maps. The data you gather through user research methods such as surveys and interviews would help you create personas and user journey maps (keep in mind the template used for creating persona and user journey maps in Product Artifacts module). Conduct user research keeping in mind the following objectives:

* Understand the pain points of the users
* Identify the goals which the users want to achieve
* User demographics
* User motivations and personality
* Technology which they use

**Part 1:**

The user research you conduct should be in two parts. Step 1 is surveys and Step 2 is user interviews.

Step 1: Conduct a survey to understand user needs/demands in the fitness industry. Sample size could be between 30-50 people so that you have a significant number to back your analysis.  
Note: While getting a large sample for the survey might be difficult, you should try to maximise the survey responses to get more clarity about the target audience.  
Step 2**:** Conduct interviews (around 5-10) with the target group. Interviews should ideally be face-to-face or they could be telephonic.

**Part 2:**

As a product manager, the user is central to all your efforts. The products you develop should revolve around the user’s goals and needs. Once you have conducted user research, the next step would be to processing the collected data and creating product artifacts. For this, you have to apply what you learnt in the module on ‘Product Artifacts’ — how to create personas and plot journey maps for your target user segment.

**Just to recap:**  
A persona is a representation of a particular user segment for the product you are developing and is based on the user research done by you. It captures a person’s motivations, frustrations and needs. You can create a persona for a user segment by taking all your user research observations and combining them to make a personality for your user.

The user journey is not just what the user’s experience is with your product, but it also includes all the steps that the user goes through in achieving that final experience.

#### Results Expected

For this assignment, you would have to:

1\. Identify the target audience for StayFit. (Word limit: 50)

2\. Prepare a questionnaire suiting your objectives using Google Forms and submit the link of the survey.

3\. Analyse the data you gathered from surveys and interviews. Draw insights out of the collected data. You can segregate your insights basis the objectives of conducting user research: users pain points, motivations, personality, goals, demographics.

4\. Create a persona for StayFit from the user research data.

5\. Create a user journey map for the given user goals:

(a) To find credible gyms near me which are within my budget  
 (b) To buy the membership for a gym
