### Problem Statement

#### Context

In the previous session, you developed a sketch for DoToday, a startup working on a next-gen to-do list and task management app. Suppose the app, based on those sketches, was launched and received a huge response from users. But the feedback was also received that a web version of the app is needed. As the PM, you have decided to develop the web version based on the current mobile version. So you need to develop wireframes for the layout of your web app. Once you have your wireframe, you also need to develop a prototype by adding interactivity to your wireframe.
