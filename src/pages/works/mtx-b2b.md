description: 'I worked as a Product Manager at MTX B2B, where I shipped a variety
  of products for the Education, Public sectors, but primarily the HealthCare industry.
  I contributed to critical products such as COVID–19 self-assessment, contact tracing,
  syndromic mapping, and vaccination apps(links: NYC, Arizona, Florida, etc).

  I also built products from the ground up like "Code Blue," which assists emergency
  medical responders in navigating the situation and assisting medical emergencies
  like cardiac or respiratory arrest.'
